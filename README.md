# Hair_Queue
A full-stack web application for managing queues in a hair salon. This project provides a digital solution for customers to join a queue and for salon staff to manage appointments efficiently.

## 📋 About
Hair_Queue is built to streamline the check-in process for hair salons. It consists of a backend API (likely built with Node.js) and a frontend client (likely built with React or a similar framework) to handle real-time queue updates and user management. The project eliminates the need for physical waiting lists by digitizing the queue.

## ✨ Features
- User Queue Management: Customers can join a queue for hair services.

- Real-time Updates: (Inferred) Likely uses WebSockets or polling to update queue positions in real-time.

- Salon Staff Dashboard: (Inferred) Allows staff to view the queue, call next customers, and manage wait times.

- User Authentication: (Inferred from project structure) Likely includes user registration and login functionality.

- Separated Frontend & Backend: Clean architecture with a dedicated frontend client and backend API server.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js (inferred)

Frontend: React.js (inferred from "forntend" folder)

Database: (Not specified, likely MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or similar)

## Key Dependencies: (Inferred)

- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

- Real-time communication: Socket.io (potential)

- Environment configuration: dotenv
